# RiggingBuddy
Auto-rigging tool that leverages the Maya Offset Parent Matrix to make more versatile and flexible rigs.

Currently this tool is only about 50% finished and will only create the locators and joints used in this rigging system. Future work is needed to add the controls and other features to the tool.

For more information on what the end goal of this tool will be, check out this link: https://garvinbeltz.artstation.com/projects/8wk1q6?album_id=3817821
